Storage =HID, Mem= XRZ, Compute =C, GP = TAM


Traffice controlled by seceurity group
Compute/Storage (for database)/Memory (critical) Optimised
Plans - 
	- Reserved (On-Demand Capacity Reservations, 1 or 3 years ) (Convertible for instance fam/type)
	- Spot (2 mins grace period)
	- Dedicated Instance (already single tenent) ( hardware may share with same account!!)
	- Dedicated Host (long-term server bound licenses ) ( per host but not instance!)
	- Bare metal = OS!!!!
	- Spot Fleet ( Run command - )
Placement
	- Cluster - for high performance, in the same rack
	- Spread - HA (maximum =7instancs per AZ) (not suitable for large distributed and replicated workloads)
	- Partition - Kafka, HDFS, Cassandra
Autoscaling
	- Scale up/down = size; Scale out/in = increase/decrease
	- Span AZ not region
	- Maintenance -> ReplaceUnhealthy = false / Put the instance to Standby
	- Wait stage = use ASG lifecycle and then exe user data there
	- Minimum best = 2 
	- Cooldown = 5mins (for stabelizing)
	- Target (%), Simple/Step (ifelse), Scheduled ,Predictive
	- Template (have different versions) better than Configuration 
		- cannot use a launch configuration to provision capacity across multiple instance types!!! Launch template can
	- Reduce
		- AZ = more instance that one 
		- Instance type (standard then spot) -> Launch Temp/Config (oldest Config then oldest template) -> next billing hour (closer first)
	-  Auto Scaling chooses the policy that provides the largest capacity
	- Lifecycle hooks 
		- Performs actions before the instance is terminated
		- Autoscale wait state/launch custom script = Lifecycle hook
	- Critical workload : minimum capacity  = minimum*no of AZ
	- Autoscaling group deleted, EC2 deleted too
		- Autoscaling and get unhealthy: Two scaling activities (one terminate + one launch) 
		- Rebalancing btw AZ: Launch before terminate old!!

Meta Data 
	- The URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
	- Or use  Instance Metadata Query tool 
Cross-Zone Load Balancing
	- With abled, distribute workload to AZ acc to the total number (eg 10 in total. 100/10)
	- Not enabled = 100/availability zone and then divide
	- By default, cross-zone load balancing is enabled for Application Load Balancer and disabled for Network Load Balancer!!
	
Monitoring
  -  Basic= every 5mins
	- Detailed = every 1 min !!!!
Hibernate
	- In mem (RAM)
	- Way faster
	- Speed up Application
	- Save the RAM state (because DeleteOnTermination is true. Once stopped, volume is gone)

EBS
	- Snapshots are incremental
	- Can change the volume size and volume type according to your needs.
	- Create a file system on that volume after attach
	- Encryption is supported by all EBS type but not ALL instance types
	- block device mapping = only for EBS/Instance Store but not EFS
	- When EC2 terminated, root volume will be terminated too but not non-root

	- SSD-backed transactional workloads  
		- Gp2/3 (3000-16000!!!!) ;3 IOPS per GB, this is the answer
		- Io1/2 (better) (64000) (can do multi attach. Only this instance type)
		- IO2 Block Express =  Max PIOPS: 256,000 
	- HDD-backed large streaming 
		- CANNOT be used as boot volumes
		- St1 Throughput optimised - for big data (like mapreduce) 500
		- Sc1 Cold - (lowest cost) 250
	- AZ locked
	- EBS data lifecycle mangemer to manage licycle of the snapshot of volume3
	- Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to backup automatically
		- If want centralise way to handle backup = AWS Backup
	- Data LIFECYCLE MANAGER!
	- Amazon EBS volumes are not automatically backed up using snapshots. You need to manually take a snapshot or you can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager

Nitro
	- 64,000 EBS IOPS – max 32,000 on non nitro
	- Multi attach to speed up IOPS

Instance store
	- Lose data when stopped
	- Data cannot be preserved
	- not supported for automatic recovery by CloudWatch alarms
	- Cant detach and apply to somewhere else
	-  can specify the instance store volumes for your instance only when you launch an instance. You can’t attach instance store volumes to an instance after you’ve launched it.


EFS 
	- POSIX\
	-  built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications !
	- 1000s concurrent NFS
	- 2 Mode
		- Performance mode
			§ GP (web server)
			§ MAXIO (big data!!, processing)
		- Throughput mode
			§ Bursting (depends on the size) (max = 1TB) ( at burst time/ peak time only)
			§ Provisioned (you set it yourself)
	- Standarad vs Infrequent Access (accessed frequently at first, and then infrequently)
	- EFS Limit usage = EFS Security Group/ Posix permissions to control
	-  EFS file system can be accessed in other AWS regions by using an inter-region VPC peering connection
	- After create a EFS Create a subdirectory for each user and grant read-write-execute permissions to the users. Then mount the subdirectory to the users’ home directory
	
AMI
	- Upon Copy AMI, there will be another AMI generated
	- Can share with other aws acc and region
	- Speed up configuration (yum)
	- Golden AMI = launch instance from it
	- Bootstrap using User Data to customise dynamic config
	- 1 EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot in region B.
	- Use EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time
EBS RAID
	- Increase IOPS
	- 0
		- Increase Performance
	- 1 
		- Fault tolerance (connect two volumes together)
EBS Multi Attach
	- IO1/2 to multi attach
	- High application availability
ELB
	- Load balancer associated with public subnet (not private)
	- REGION BASSED
	- Enable ELB to encrypt communications using the SSL / TLS protocol.
	- To connect to private subnet, add ELB to their public subnets
	- Connection draining - stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy 
	- Classic - fixed hostname
	- NO FAILOVER
	- GEO BLOCK = WAF
	- To check ALB health, use Route53!!!
	- Application - path based
		- NOT autoscling if fail healthcheck, wont send to that ec2 machine
		- Https/http
		- Route to Private IP!
		- Failover??? Nope
		- AKA  content based routing
		- Provides only domain name
		- Dynamic port mapping
		- ALB supports authentication from OIDC compliant identity 
		- ALB partner with EC2 autoscale (health check to terminate unhealthy)
		- How to block countries?
	- Network
		- TCP/UDP/TLS
		- Provides static IP IP and domain name
		- Route to Private IP!
		- Sticky session 
			§ No more reauthentication becoz going to the same EC2 instance
			§ Application based cookies
				□ Generated by rarget for Custom. (AWSALBTG and the two below are reserved, other than that ok)
				□ Generated by load balancer for Application AWSALBAPP
			§ Duration based cookies
				□ By loadbalancar
				□ NAME = AWSALB
		- Most powerful one 
		- Use with autoscaling best
		- Layer 4
	- Need a private IP address
	- HTTP 503: Service unavailable
	- Block country needa use WAF!
	- HTTPS = 443! Http =80
	- Server Name indication = user to load multiple SSL certificates (onto the balancer) (netlify)
	- To get the client's IP address, ALB adds an additional header called "X-Forwarded-For" contains the client's IP address.
	- Enable VPC!!!!'s DNS hostnames access logs! So that instances have DNS!
	- TO encrypt data in transit
	You can passthrough encrypted traffic with an NLB and terminate the SSL on the EC2 instances, so this is a valid answer.
	You can use a HTTPS listener with an ALB and install certificates on both the ALB and EC2 instances. This does not use passthrough, instead it will terminate the first SSL connection on the ALB and then re-encrypt the traffic and connect to the EC2 instances.
	

Fargate
	- No need to provision
	- Serverless !!! (EC2 is not!)
	- ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used. ECS with Fargate launch type is charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests

Elastic Fabric Adapter
	- HPC workflows
	- MPI standard

AWS Batch
	- Service managed
	- Multi node parallel jobs
	- Easily schedule 
	- Manged version of placement cluster


Security Group
Default security groups have inbound allow rules (allowing traffic from within the group) whereas custom security groups do not have inbound allow rules (all inbound traffic is denied by default). All outbound traffic is allowed by default in custom and default security groups.


Meta vs user data
Meta = IAM role, instancef name, security name
Userdata = command to be ran




With Amazon EFS, you pay only for the resources that you use (like access). The EFS Standard Storage pricing is $0.30 per GB per month.
For EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes, the charges are $0.10 per GB-month of provisioned storage.  This cost is irrespective of how much storage is actually consumed by the test file.


Turn deleteontermination = false so that ebs is kept
 the Root volume type will be deleted as its "Delete On Termination" attribute checked by default. Any other EBS volume types will not be deleted as its "Delete On Termination" attribute disabled by default.


Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet-per-second (PPS) - basically internet


user data runs only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance
scripts entered as user data are executed with root user privileges

Deregistration delay = time to deregister by autoscaling (increase if have long workload time)




A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata
If your instance has a public IPv4 address,  it retains the public IPv4 address after recovery


Configuration (Tenancy)


You can change the tenancy of an instance from dedicated to host
You can change the tenancy of an instance from host to dedicated
(default = shared) Cannot after provision


instance store volumes are not supported for automatic recovery by CloudWatch alarms. Data is deleted afterwards


Load balancer unhealthy but can access website
	The security group of the EC2 instance does not allow for traffic from the security group of the Application Load Balancer
	The route for the health check is misconfigured



AWS Cost Explorer Resource Optimization to see the low utilized ones


Data is encrypted at rest, moving, and in snapshot

Add external ec2s to autoscaling group would result in exceeding maximum capity



Autoscale
Unhealthy (ALB)  terminate + add new
Unbalanced - launch before terminate old


Use instance profile for EC2 (service role)
