Lambda
	- No php; C# ok 
	- Limit = 1000 concurrent ( need to contact aws to add more)
	- 512 MB maximum
	- AWS step function = workflow in a easy way
	- AWS BATCH
		○ Lambda only up to 15 mins per execution. If more, need to use ec2
	- Lambda Layer for reuse 
	- Track number of request and latency
API Gateway
	- Can cache
		○ Cache and then needa configure a TTL . The default TTL value for API caching is 300 seconds. The maximum TTL value is 3600 seconds. TTL=0 means caching is disabled.
	- When too many read request, = 429 too many requests When us throtting!!!
	- stateless client-server communication, WebSocket is stateful
	- Throttle rules to limit requests (perclient mode to restrict client max request)
Cognito
	- User - access to aws (the one I used),authenticate/authorisation JWT
	- Identity - have aws credentials to access!!!, STS
	- Use Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools for your Application Load Balancer!
	
Cheapest scheduled job
Schedule a weekly CloudWatch event cron expression to invoke a Lambda function that runs the database rollover job
