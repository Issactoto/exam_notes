SQS (FIFO) (Standard thgoughput = unlimited)
	FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (WITHout batching) ; With barching = 3000
	- Delay queues to delay message sending
		- IF you want CERTAIN message to be delayed, use Message Timers
	- Default retention days is 4!!!
	- Make sure that the name of the FIFO queue ends with the .fifo suffix
	- Deadletter queue (up to 14 days)
	- postpone up to 15 mins
	- For decouple!! (third part app= eventbridge)
	- Long request = cheaper way to minimize cost
	-  the Standard SQS queue is only allowed as an Amazon S3 event notification destination, whereas the FIFO SQS queue is not allowed.
	- Temporary Queue Client
		- request-response message
		- Cost effective
	- If multiple instances, once only thn SQS no SNS
	- Use Priority for prioritise
	- Visibility timeout
	- Long Polling:
	– Uses fewer requests and reduces cost.
	– Eliminates false empty!! responses by querying all servers.
	– SQS waits until a message is available in the queue before sending a response.
	- Short Polling:
	– Does not wait for messages to appear in the queue.
	– It queries only a subset of the available servers for messages (based on weighted random execution).
	– Short polling is the default.
	– ReceiveMessageWaitTime is set to 0.

SNS (have FIFO)
	- Use case = to monitor EC2 and send 
	- MOBILE NOTI! Email noti = SES
	- Does not store!
	- 
Kinesis
	- Better option for Streaming, REALTIME!!
	- Increase shard to when read exceeds
	Kinesis Data Stream
		- Use lambda, Ec2, Data Analytics
		-  stores data for a maximum of 365 days, you can easily run the audit application up to 7 days
		- Processing
		- ProvisionedThroughputExceededException -> use batch
		- Enhanced fanout to add IO
	Kinesis Firehose
		- Go to database (S3/ Redshift)  (NOT Dynamo/EMR)and other external stuff
		- Load data only
		- Automatically scales (Data stream needs to provision; this dun need)
	Kinesis Data Analytics
		- Need data stream
	
Amazon MQ
	- MQTT, WSS and other protocols

EMR 
	- Big data (hadoop!!!), MACHINE LEARNING and streaming data analysis
	- Autoscale with spot instances
	- Analyze and process data
	- (vs Glue)
	- To lower cost = use spot instance
	- NOT Serverless, needa manage underlying resources
	
 data processing, machine learning,



When a Kinesis data stream is configured as the source of a Firehose delivery stream, Firehose’s PutRecord and PutRecordBatch operations are disabl
