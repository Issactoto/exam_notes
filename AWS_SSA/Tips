WAF + Cloudfront very secured!!




Configure encryption for the Amazon EBS volumes and Amazon RDS database with AWS KMS keys

Analytics = create another read replica

Inbound vs Outbound (most time = inbound for security)


EFS can communicate with Fargate!

Cost: S3<EFS<EBS

To coordinate Availability Zones across accounts, you must use the AZ ID,

Dynamodb will not cause downtime when autoscale but Aurora will 

If sso of company (like IBM's), use STS and SAML

Allow penetration test for 8 serivces

EC2 -> database = use IAM role

EC2 - high avilability of 4 nodes = use 3 zones with 2 nodes so that if one zone fails, still available! 

Set a password policy for the entire AWS account

EC2 ASG Spot+ Reserved = launch template
Web server -> database = security group

Cheaper- Reserved = all here
・EC2 Reserved Instance
・RDS Reserved Instance
・ElastiCache Reserved Node
・DynamoDB Reserved Capacity
・Redshift Reserved Node


the only resource-based policy that the IAM service supports? = Trust Policy
The instance has failed the ELB health check status 
ASG wont terminate the instance


Caching cheaper than Replicas!

Never Allow security group of SUBNET! Overkill even ASG!
CIDR 
2^8=256
/24 = 2^8!!!!!! *(not 7 !)
