	1. Introduction 
	• IBM Cloud: High Level Overview
		Robust Console, IAM, Catalog, Acc Billings
		Access= IBM Console / Command line interface
	• Locations, Regions, and Zones
		6 regions, 18 zones, 60 centers
		Multi zone cluster = >3 zones within 6miles
		Ibm = multizone regions, single zone region
	• Account Types and Support Plans
	Lite, pay as you go, subscription
	Support = Basic, Advacned (1to8 hours reponse) and Premium (Technical Account Manager)
	Case Severity = 4Minimal, 3 Some, 2 Significant, 1 Critical
	• Billing and Usage
		Monthly overview or specific service for review
	• Cost Estimator
	Pdf, csv, xlsx
	• Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
		Users, access groups, resource, resource groups (to provide access to multiple resources at once.)
		
		Resource = an instance of service
		
	2. Infrastructure
	• Virtual Servers and Bare Metal 
		Virtual Servers - cheapest (hourly and monthly)
		Bare Metal Servers (Vmware, Cirtix, Cloud linux images)- performance, can be no OS
		Power System Servers - performance
		Hyper Protect Servers (LinuxOne) - Security
		
		Plan: Public (), Dedicated, Transient, Reserved
	• Block and File Storage
		Block = Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSi) storage
		Block up to 12TB
	• Object Storage
		Up to 10TB for an object
		Cross region, regional, single data center
		Tier -> Smart, Standard, Vault (once a month), Cold Vault (Data only access a few times in a year)
	• Network Services
		Gateway Appliance, VPN, VLAN
		CDN is a highly distributed platform of servers used to help minimize delays. IBM Cloud’s CDN services is based off Akamai 
		A load balancer is used to distribute traffic among virtual servers. 
	• Virtual Private Cloud
		Resource Group Name and SSH Key are required when creating a virtual server in a VCP
		Generation 1 or Generation 2
		Private subnets and encrypted communication Achieve isolation between workloads on VPCs on IBM Cloud.
	• Vmware
		Vmware solution Dedicated (Bare Metal) vs Share (Vmware Cloud Director)
		Veeam is used to back up and replicate virtual machines on VMware.
		
	3. Deploying
	• Containers and Kubernetes
		Container =package that contains application source code dependencies, like runtimes, binaries, libraries, and data. 
		Container is configured to communicate with a specific k8s cluster
		+= run uniformly, increase speed and security
		K8s isnt simple
	• OpenShift
		- Has Kubernetes’ core framework plus all of OpenShift's abstractions.
	• Cloud Foundry 
	• Cloud Functions
		Action = building blocks
		
	4. Services on IBM Cloud

• Databases
	Db2, cloudant nosql (document-orianted), redis
• Integration
	Api connect, app connect, mq, event stream (Watson Internet of Things (IoT) and IBM Cloud functions, Kafka)
• Artificial Intelligence 
	Watson studio ML, NLP
• Analytics
	Analytics engine (Hadoop + Spark), Streaming analysis, db2 wawrehouse
• DevOps
	Tekton pipelines are specified in yaml
• Blockchain
Hyperladger Fabric
• Internet of Things
• Cloud Paks
 data = integrates data management, data governance, and analysis 
Multicloud
All on Openshift

Openshift is based on opensource project OKD
Webhook is a Red Hat OpenShift build trigger. 
Operator at Openfhift = RH, Certified and Community

What enables communication to the internet for all virtual server instances on the attached subnet?
Public Gateway


A VPN service can assist a client in connecting an application on IBM Cloud with the client’s private network.
