Introduction to Cloud
	1. Introduction and Objectives
	Definition: A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of compute resources
• Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
	- On demand SELF service
	- Broad NETWORK
	- RESOURCE pooling
	- RAPID ELASTICITY
	- Measured service
	- Three types of models - IAS, PAAS, SAAS
	- Multicloud = 2 more cloud providers
 • History and Evolution of Cloud Computing
	- 1950 =MF
	- 1970 = OS called VM made possible for mainframe
	- 2000 = Hypervisors (One physical run virtual systems)
• Key Considerations for Cloud Computing
	- Flexibility
	- Agility
	- Competitiveness
	- Risk = Data security
	
• Key Cloud Service Providers and Their Services
	- IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are generally known as the service models.
	- Pay-as-you-go is another term used for the utility billing method.

	2. Cloud Adoption and Emerging Technologies
	• Cloud Adoption – No Longer a Choice 
		○ The power, scalability, flexibility, and pay-as-you-go economics provided the foundation for the transformation to the cloud.
		○ 75% enterprises today are using cloud computing to expand new industries
		○ 2025 = 163 zettabytes of data 
	• Cloud Adoption – Some Case Studies 
	• Internet of Things (IoT) on the Cloud 
		○ The concept of connecting any device (so long as it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and to other connected devices.
		- Advantages: Control in real time , reduce cost, no human intervention
		- Disadvantages: Security, Privacy
		-  smart assistant is an IoT device that tracks data and information and continues
	• Artificial Intelligence on the Cloud 
		- Look at case studies
	• Blockchain and Analytics on the Cloud 
		- What type of relationship exists between IoT, AI, and the cloud?
		
	3. Cloud Computing Service and Deployment Models
		- Overview of Service Models
			§ IAAS,PAAS, SAAS 
		- Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
			§ The user/persona for IaaS is the system administrator.
		- Platform-as-a-Service 
			§ + = Scalability, greate agility and innovation , middleware
			§ -= security, dependant on provider infra
			§ Eample = IBM Cloud pak, Redhat openshift, aws elastic beanstalk
		- Software-as-a-Service 
			§ Exmaple: CRM, Email
			§ =+ directly have a solution
			§ -= no data ownership/safety/privacy
		- Public Cloud 
			§ Enable tenants or users to share computing resources residing outside their firewall
			§ += seamlessly to fluctuations in demand,  build secondary infrastructures for disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity. Reduce time to market
			§ -= Security
		- Private Cloud 
			§  may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. 
			§ Virtual private cloud = infra used exclusively by the client
			§ +=modernize and unify an organization’s in- house and legacy applications.
		- Hybrid Cloud 
			§ connects an organization’s on-premises private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single 
			- SAAS integration, Enhanced legacy, Vmware migaration
			- +=Interoperability, scalability, and portability , Resource optimization!!!
	4. Components of Cloud Computing
		- Overview of Cloud Infrastructure 
			- Regions,>Zones>Data Centers
		- Virtualization and Virtual Machines Explained 
			- Virtual Servers (hypervisor), Bare Metal Servers (in rack that are not virtualised), Serverless
			- Hypervisor = pull resource from physical to an virtual env
		- Types of Virtual Machines 
			- Hypervisors - type 1 : Installed directly on top of physical server (Vmware, MS!)
						◊ Type 2 (Hosted) : A later of hosting OS that sits between physical and hypervisor (VirtualBox, Vmware workstation)
			- Virtual Machine = cost savings, agile and speeedy, portable
			- Types: Shared, Transient, Dedicated
		- Bare Metal Servers 
			- Dedicated to customer, provider responsible for fixing hardware and rack connections only
			- += customizable, long term, security, full access, works best for CPU IO intenseive workloads, AI, ERP, CRM deeplearning
			- -=custom builds can take 3-4hrs, not all cloud providers, updates are difficult, expensive
			- Bare metal and virtual servers are provisioned with default storage in local drives.
		- Secure Networking in Cloud 
			- ACL
			- A public gateway is added to the network to enable users’ access to the application in the internet tier..
		- Containers 
			- Portability. Scalability

	5. Cloud Computing Storage, Content Delivery Network
	• Basics of Cloud Storage 
		- Direct Attached - aka local, cannot be shared with other node
		- File - must be attached to one compute node in order to have access. Nework File system, resilient to failure, consistent speed cannot be hguaranteed. Network Attached
		- Block - break files into chunks. Suitable for databasess where disk speed is important. Encryption:))
				□ -= cannot be disk shared with other compute nodes; more expensive
		- Object - accessed via API , least esxpensive, IOT, relatively slow, not attached to node, good for unstructured data
	• File Storage 
	• Block Storage 
	• Object Storage Overview 
	• Object Storage – Tiers and APIs 
	• Content Delivery Networksdoes 
		- distributed server network that delivers temporarily stored, or cached, copies of website content
		- Better performance and user experience. 
		-  Ease of use – increases websites speeds and file distribution. 
		-  Cost efficiencies. •
		- Scalable and secure. •
		- Usage based pricing.

	6. Emerging Trends
	• Hybrid Multicloud 
		- += cloud scaling, 
	• Microservices 
		- += independently dploable, scalable, updated easily
	• Serverless Computing 
	• Cloud-Native Applications 
		- Microservices, automation and orchestration
	• DevOps in the Cloud 
		- Planning, dev, int, deploy, operat, feedback
	• Application Modernization 
	• += cost, complexity
	
	
	
	
	Case Study
	
	American Airline - Customer service
	Ubank - faster for innovation
	Bitly -  cost-effective + scalable
	ActivTrade - Vmware for secure. Boost performace
	
	System administrator = user of IAAS
	
	Private vs Public = can users share resources
	
	
	
	Public gateway
	 
	A public gateway is added to the network to enable users’ access to the application in the internet tier.
	
	
	
VPN = connect cloud to private network
