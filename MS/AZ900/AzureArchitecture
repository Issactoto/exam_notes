Describe the core architectural components of Azure
  1. AZ
      * not all azure regions support availability zones
      * Zone
        Zonal services (VM)
        Zone redundant (SQL)
      * Region
        Supported Region has 3 more AZ
      * Region Pair (DR)
        Customer cannot choose
        Each region is paired
      * Geographies (two or more regions)
         In the same geography
  2. Resource
       * Resource
          save as json 
          MUST be in one and only one group
       * Resource group
          logically grouped (Cant be nested, can in diff region)
       * Resource Manager
          access

Describe Azure compute and networking services
  1. Compute
      * VM (only IAAS here, all other are PAA)
      * Container Instance (autoscaling)
      * Kubernetes
      * App Service
      * Function
  2. Networking
      * Virtual Network
        Region based
        Logically connected
        VNet peering allow cross region communication
      * Load Balancer
        tcp/udp
      * VPN Gateway
         connect on-premises to azure traffic over the public internet
      * Application Gateway
          Web traffic load balancer (HTTP)
          URL routing
      * CDN
          Minimize latency
Describe Azure storage services

Storage
  * blob storage (container)
    object (HOT, COOL (low availability), Archive)
  * queue storage
  * table storage 
    semi structured; NOSQL
    fast
  * file storage
    Shared drive
    Onprem file sharing
    =blob but use SMB
  * disk storage
  
Database
* Cosmos
  Globally distributed NoSQL 
* SQL

Other
* Azure Marketplace (Self and Third party)
* Azure IOT
  Hub (PAAS)
  Central with templates (SAAS)
  Sphere OS
* Big data
  Synapse Analytics - Synapase SQL
  Azure HDInsight (multipurpose) - all apache
  Databricks = Spark
  
  
Describe Azure identity, access, and security

concepts
  * Identity
    User
  * Authentication
    Verify
  * Authorization
    Grant access
    
Access    
Azure Active Directory
- Identity + access management
-A user with a username and password or applications or other servers with secret keys or certificates.
- Azure ID
- User 
- Group

MFA
- knowledge
- physical (fingerprint)
- possession (phone)
- locaiton
=2 or more of the above
  

Role-based access control
Role definition – list of permissions like create VM, delete SQL, assign permissions, etc. V
Security Principal – user, group, service principal and managed identity S
Scope – resource, resource groups, subscription, management group O (Management Groups > Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources)

Security Principal -> Role definition -> Scope

Microsoft Defender for Cloud
DEFAULT - Free (Azure Defender OFF) – included in all Azure services, provides continuous assessments, security score, and actionable security recommendations
Paid (Azure Defender ON) – hybrid security, threat protection alerts, vulnerability scanning, just in time (JIT) VM access, etc.
