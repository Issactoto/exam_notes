Describe the core architectural components of Azure
  1. AZ
      * not all azure regions support availability zones
      * each az may have diff host
      * Zone
        Zonal services (VM)
        Zone redundant (SQL)
      * Region
        Supported Region has 3 more AZ
      * Region Pair (DR)
        Customer cannot choose
        Each region is paired
      * Geographies (two or more regions)
         In the same geography
         * GEO redundant = 3 (in the same region) * 2 ( in diff regions) = 6
        * Soveriegn = China/ German/ US (stricter policies); Japan/ other nope; so they use normal one - global
  2. Resource
       * Resource
          save as json 
          MUST be in one and only one group
       * Resource group
          logically grouped (Cant be nested, can in diff region)
       * Resource Manager
          access

Describe Azure compute and networking services
  1. Compute
      * VM (only IAAS here, all other are PAA)
        99.9% if 2 machines in two different env
        Stop (delocate) is cheaper
      * Container Instance (autoscaling)
      * Kubernetes
      * App Service
      * Function
  2. Networking
      * Virtual Network
        Region based!!
        Logically connected
        VNet peering allow cross region communication
          not public network; microsoft's one
      * Load Balancer
        tcp/udp
      * VPN Gateway
         connect on-premises to azure traffic over the public internet
          Site to site (vpn - vpn), Point to site (computer to cloud vpn)
      * Application Gateway
          Web traffic load balancer (HTTP)
          with Web application firewall
          URL routing
      * Express Route ( private) - fastest one - FOR ONPREM only ; not vpn x vpn
      * CDN
          Minimize latency
Describe Azure storage services

Storage
  * storage has at least three copies (may not be diff datacenter)
  * enabled by default
  * blob storage (container)
    object (Premium, HOT, COOL (low availability), Archive)
  * queue storage
  * table storage 
    semi structured; NOSQL
    fast
  * file storage
    Shared drive
    Onprem file sharing
    =blob but use SMB
  * disk storage
  Locally/ Geo/zone redundant
  
Database
* Cosmos
  Globally distributed NoSQL 
* SQL
* Power BI to analyze = Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL Symtase.

Other
* Azure Marketplace (Self and Third party)
* Azure IOT
  Hub (PAAS)
  Central with templates (SAAS)
  Sphere OS!!!! AND Hardware
* Big data
  Synapse Analytics - Synapase SQL
  Azure HDInsight (multipurpose) - all apache
  Databricks = Spark
  
  
Describe Azure identity, access, and security

concepts
  * Identity
    User
  * Authentication
    Verify
  * Authorization
    Grant access
    
Access    
Azure Active Directory
- Identity + access management
-A user with a username and password or applications or other servers with secret keys or certificates.
- Azure ID
- User 
- Group
- AD Connect = connect on prem and cloud ad

MFA
- knowledge
- physical (fingerprint)
- possession (phone)
- locaiton
=2 or more of the above
  
Key Vault
Safeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services

Azure Information Protection
automatically add watermarks to Microsoft Word documents that contain credit card information.
Can protect  and encrypt documents and emails but not encrypt network sql and storage


Role-based access control
Role definition – list of permissions like create VM, delete SQL, assign permissions, etc. V
Security Principal – user, group, service principal and managed identity S
Scope – resource, resource groups, subscription, management group O (Management Groups (Management group mangages multi sub) > Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources)

Security Principal -> Role definition -> Scope

Microsoft Defender for Cloud
DEFAULT - Free (Azure Defender OFF) – included in all Azure services, provides continuous assessments, security score, and actionable security recommendations
Paid (Azure Defender ON) – hybrid security, threat protection alerts, vulnerability scanning, just in time (JIT) VM access, etc.  


Azure Machine Learning vs Hub


DevOps
Repo = manage code
devtest
